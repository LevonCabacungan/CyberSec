      <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks 
        are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or 
        interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging 
        today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
        A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, 
        or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement 
        one another to create an effective defense from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can automate integrations 
        across select Cisco Security products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, 
        and remediation.
